<p> We all live on our planet, but by no means all think or care about the environment. The term environment refers on the one hand to the natural conditions in a specific place and on the other hand to its ecological condition. The natural environment has a great and immediate influence on people. For this reason, our relationships with the environment must have a harmonious character. Only this gives people health and promotes the harmonious development of human society.
 Humanity exerts a great influence on the environment. In many cases this influence is very negative. For this reason, environmental protection has become very important, because the measures to be carried out within its framework reduce the ruinous impact of people on the environment.
 In the course of life, the human organism is subject to the constant influence of various environmental factors. These environmental factors directly influence the functionality, health and longevity of mankind. The most important importance for human health is the purity of the air that people breathe and the purity of the water that they drink. </p>
