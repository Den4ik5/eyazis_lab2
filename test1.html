<p> We all need coffee or tea for breakfast. We often serve milk and sugar with it. In addition, one usually eats fried eggs, omelets or various sandwiches with sausage, cheese, fish and pies for breakfast. To prepare all of this, we need to buy all the necessary products. For this reason, we visit different grocery stores and buy our favorite products there.
    At lunch you usually serve different starters, soups, main dishes and desserts. Starters can be prepared from all sorts of things: they can be salads, herbs and similar things. Soups are soups, everything is clear here. Main courses can consist of meat, poultry, fish, game and a side dish. Desserts are always all kinds of sweets. </p>
