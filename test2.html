<p> The costume is part of the culture. Russian folk costume is very original and beautiful. The headscarf was an everyday item of clothing that all women and girls wore. Headgear was compulsory for a married woman; girls could walk with their bare heads. A traditional headgear was the kokochnik, which could have a wide variety of shapes: triangular or round. It depended on the region. The kokochnik was often tied with ribbons and adorned with pearls.

 A sarafan is a traditional Russian women's costume, which is a long, sleeveless robe that women and girls wore with a blouse. A long skirt was also worn in southern Russia. After the reform of Peter the Great, noble women stopped wearing sarafan, they wore European clothes and so the sarafan became peasant clothes. Often blouses and sarafans were adorned with an ornament and the ornament always had a meaning. The ornament was something of a good luck charm, and people believed that an ornament could protect. </p>
